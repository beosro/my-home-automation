#  Various scene definitions. A scene is a set of
#  states that should be enabled at the same time.

#  The holiday state sets a festive color on the common
#  area lights, and turns on the smart switches, which
#  are presumably attached to holiday lights.


#  The romantic state switches the lights to purple
#  and turns off lights in utilitarian rooms.
