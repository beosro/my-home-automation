# People
#
#  People exist in various states. Keep track of these and act
#  accordingly.
#
#  - Sleeping: This state is used daily and is critical. First, when
#              sleep mode is enabled, TTS briefings, door chimes, and
#              and various other potential disturbances are disabled.
#              Secondly, the house is placed in a convenient state for
#              sleeping occupants.
#  - Guests: Having guests means accomodating untracked people. Don't
#            rely on tracked people to control temperature, lights, etc.
#            Guests are quickly annoyed by home automation that doesn't
#            take their presence into account.
#  - Vacation: When no one is home for an extended period, don't bother
#              changing states.
