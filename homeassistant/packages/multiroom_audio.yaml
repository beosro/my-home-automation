# Multi-Room Audio
#
#  Multi-room audio consists of a network of speakers throughout the
#  house. Each speaker can be assigned to a channel, and all speakers
#  on the same channel play the same thing, with time synchronization.
#
#  There are three different audio sources:
#  1) Spotify: librespot acts as a "Spotify Connect"-enabled device.
#              This means that it can be selected via the mobile app,
#              desktop client, etc (just like Alexa, for example). The
#              librespot instance is named "Multi-room audio". Playing
#              to the device routes audio to the server.
#  2) Local Music: Music Player Daemon aka "mpd" is a music server that
#                  manages local audio files.
#  3) TTS: Text-to-speech messages generated by Home Assistant
#
#  The audio distribution from the server to the speakers is via the
#  open-source software "snapcast". It has a server component that reads
#  from a named pipe per audio source, and client components that run
#  local to each speaker (in my case, on Raspberry Pis). It controls
#  the channels ("groups") and synchronization.
